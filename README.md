# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹  

I am an aspiring software engineer, presently in my final year of Engineering. I enjoy connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I am working on developing strong technical skills and an decent academic background in engineering, statistics, and IT support. 

I enjoy creating things, which is a big factor in my decision to pursue a career in technology. Growing up, I enjoyed painting and playing outdoor games like badminton and basketball with my friends. It makes me very happy that I chose this field since I get to spend most of my day thinking of innovative solutions and writing code to automate basic mundane tasks with the help of technology.
